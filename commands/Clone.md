# git clone

Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an assoicated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history

It will also be assoicated with the remote, meanig that you can use the `git pull` command to pull updates from the original repository.

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:

```
git clone https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/TerminalDungeon.git
```
